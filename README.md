Some of graph theory algorithms

**NB:** You must have knowledge of pointers and structures in C to understand.

## Description of algorithms

  1. list_graph.c:
      * Define the elements of the list.
      * the list with data from the graph.
      * Display the successors of each vertex.
      * Display the number of successors for each vertex.
      * Display the predecessors of each vertex.
  
  2. strongly connected components.c
      * A procedure that allows for the calculation of strongly connected components of a graph. (Application of the Malgrange Algorithm: decomposition of a  graph into strongly connected components)  
  
  3. kruskal.c
      * A program that models the Kruskal's algorithm.  
  
  4. ordinal_function.c
      * A C program to determine the ordinal function of a cycle-free tree (levels).
  
  5. ford_algorithm.c
      * A program that enables the implementation of the Ford algorithm.
